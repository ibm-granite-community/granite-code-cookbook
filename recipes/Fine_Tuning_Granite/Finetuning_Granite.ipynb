    "# Fine-tuning a Code Instruction Model for Legal Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to fine-tune the `ibm-granite/granite-3b-code-instruct-2k` model, a small code instruction model, on a legal dataset using the qLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) technique. This experiment serves two primary purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Educational: It showcases the process of adapting a pre-trained model to a new domain.\n",
    "2. Practical: It illustrates how a model's interpretation of domain-specific terms (like 'inheritance') can shift based on the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll walk through several key steps:\n",
    "- Installing necessary dependencies\n",
    "- Loading and exploring the dataset\n",
    "- Setting up the quantized model\n",
    "- Performing a sanity check\n",
    "- Configuring and executing the training process\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, we'll have a model that has learned to interpret legal concepts, demonstrating the power and flexibility of transfer learning in NLP."
