    "This notebook showcases querying any dataset, such as social media dataset (Twitter in this case), using natural language to generate SQL queries with the help of LLM (Granite-Code-20B). As we go through this notebook, we will come across two different kinds of prompting techniques incorporated into this demo. One being `zero-shot` prompting, which includes a straightforward prompt, and another one being `few-shot` prompting, where in addition to a prompt, we have given a couple of examples for the model to understand and generate a better SQL query. At the end, we also tested out the `chain of thought` reasoning."
