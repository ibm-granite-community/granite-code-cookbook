    "# Auto-generating Documentation: A Long Document Summarization Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates an innovative application of long document summarization techniques to automatically generate documentation for Python code. By treating a codebase as a \"long document,\" we leverage AI-powered language models to comprehend, distill, and explain complex code structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key concepts:\n",
    "1. Document preprocessing: We fetch and format code from a GitHub repository, similar to how one might prepare a long text document for summarization.\n",
    "2. Chunking and tokenization: We analyze the token count of our code \"document\" to ensure it fits within the model's context window, a crucial step in long document processing.\n",
    "3. Prompt engineering: We craft a specialized prompt that guides the AI to focus on key aspects of the code, much like how summarization prompts direct models to capture essential information.\n",
    "4. AI-powered analysis: Using the Replicate API, we access a large language model capable of understanding code semantics and generating human-readable explanations.\n",
    "5. Structured output: We instruct the model to produce documentation in a consistent format, analogous to generating structured summaries from lengthy texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach demonstrates how techniques traditionally used for summarizing long articles, reports, or books can be adapted for technical documentation tasks. It showcases the versatility of large language models in processing and synthesizing complex information, whether it's natural language or programming code.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll see how principles of long document summarization can be applied to streamline and enhance the software documentation process, potentially saving developers significant time and effort."
